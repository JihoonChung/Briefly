Trump expressed interest in achieving European peace and resolving the Ukrainian conflict, and has privately suggested supporting a deal where Russia retains some captured territories.

Trump's criticism of extensive U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine, and suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory for peace, stand in contrast to President Biden's steadfast support for Ukraine, which may change with a Republican-controlled Senate under Trump's incoming administration. Meanwhile, Ukraine continues to engage in significant military actions against Russia, highlighting ongoing tensions as allies express concerns over the implications of Trump's policies and potential diplomatic strategy for the conflict.\n",
