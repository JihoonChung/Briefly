    zero_shot_summary = "The Kansas City Chiefs have traded for wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins from the Tennessee Titans, sending a conditional 2025 fifth-round pick in exchange. If the Chiefs reach the Super Bowl and Hopkins plays 60% of the snaps, the pick will be upgraded to a fourth-rounder, with Tennessee also covering $2.5 million of Hopkins' remaining salary. The Chiefs needed reinforcements at wide receiver after several injuries, including season-ending surgery for Rashee Rice and hamstring issues for JuJu Smith-Schuster. Hopkinsâ€™ addition gives Patrick Mahomes another target as Kansas City aims to strengthen their offense. For the Titans, this trade marks a shift toward rebuilding, as they also dealt linebacker Ernest Jones IV to Seattle."
