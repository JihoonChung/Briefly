President-elect Donald Trump says that Tom Homan, his former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, will serve as “border czar” in his incoming administration.

“I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation’s Borders,” he wrote late Sunday on his Truth Social site.

Homan was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border and Trump’s pledge to launch the largest deportation operation in the country’s history.

In addition to overseeing the southern and northern borders and “maritime, and aviation security,” Trump said Homan “will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,” a central part of his agenda.

He says he had “no doubt” Homan “will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.”

In an interview on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Homan said the military would not be rounding up and arresting immigrants in the country illegally and that ICE would move to implement Trump’s plans in a “humane manner.”

“It’s going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They’re good at it,” he said. “When we go out there, we’re going to know who we’re looking for. We most likely know where they’re going to be, and it’s going to be done in a humane manner.”

Earlier this year at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, Homan expressed frustration at the news coverage of a mass deportation operation.

“Wait until 2025,” he said, adding that, while he thinks the government needed to prioritize national security threats, “no one’s off the table. If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”

He also said: “you’ve got my word. Trump comes back in January, I’ll be in his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”

1731361091,2024-11-11,Politics,Trump names Stephen Miller to be deputy chief of policy in new administration,"NEW YORK -

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is naming longtime adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.

Confirming the appointment, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted a message of congratulations on Monday to Miller on X and said, ""This is another fantastic pick by the president."" The announcement was first reported by CNN.

Miller is one of Trump's longest-serving aides, dating back to his first campaign for the White House. He was a senior adviser in Trump's first term and has been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including Trump's move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018.

Miller has also helped craft many of Trump's hard-line speeches, and was often the public face of those policies during Trump's first term in office and during his campaigns.

Since leaving the White House, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

He was also a frequent presence during Trump's campaign this year, travelling aboard his plane and often speaking ahead of Trump during the pre-shows at his rallies.

Miller drew large cheers at Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden during the race's final stretch, telling the crowd that, ""your salvation is at hand,"" after what he cast as ""decades of abuse that has been heaped upon the good people of this nation -- their jobs looted and stolen from them and shipped to Mexico, Asia and foreign countries. The lives of their loved ones ripped away from them by illegal aliens, criminal gangs and thugs who don't belong in this country.""

""We stand here today at a crossroads,"" he went on, casting the election as ""a choice between betrayal and renewal, between self-destruction and salvation, between the failure of America or the triumph of America.""

Because it is not a Cabinet position, the appointment does not need Senate confirmation.

A Kremlin spokesperson said the reports were ""pure fiction"", while Trump's team told the BBC that it would not comment on the president-elect's ""private calls"".

Trump is also reported to have mentioned America's extensive military presence in Europe to Putin.

The call, which was first reported by the Washington Post on Sunday, is said to have happened on Thursday.

The Kremlin has denied media reports that US President-elect Donald Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, in which he is said to have warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.

Trump's communications director Steven Cheung told the BBC: ""We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.""

But he said leaders had begun the process of contacting the president-elect.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied a conversation had taken place.

""This is completely untrue, it is pure fiction. That is, this is simply false information. There was no conversation,"" Peskov said.

Trump has promised to end the nearly three-year long war in Ukraine, but has yet to outline how he intends to do so.

Zelensky has previously warned against conceding land to Russia and has said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war.

While Peskov on Sunday spoke to Russian state media of ""positive"" signals from the incoming US administration, others say they trust the future president will not abandon Ukraine.

They include John Healey, the British defence secretary, who said he expected the US ""to remain alongside allies like the UK, standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes to prevail over Putin's invasion"".

On Sunday, during a visit to Ukraine, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that any end to the war needed to be sustainable.

""This is a warning for the ones who say, this war has to end, so let's finish it as soon as possible no matter how. How matters,"" he said.

In Washington, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said outgoing president Joe Biden would make the case to Trump that walking away from Ukraine would mean greater instability in Europe.

On Monday, Germany's Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, warned that Putin could take advantage of the US post-election transition period to press Moscow's advantage in Ukraine.

Urging Berlin and fellow European Union member states to increase aid to Kyiv, she said: ""We don't have time to wait until spring. Now is the transition phase that Putin has been waiting for and aiming for.""

A dam close to the front line in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region was damaged on Monday, according to regional head Vadym Filashkin.

Filashkin said the Kurakhove reservoir's dam was hit by a Russian strike, warning rising water ""potentially threatens"" settlements on the Vovcha River. Russia claimed Ukraine was responsible.

1731361258,2024-11-11,Politics,Trump expected to announce Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy,"CNN —

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce in the coming days that Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, will serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.

Miller, who served as a senior adviser to Trump and was his lead speechwriter during his first administration, has been a leading advocate for a more restrictive immigration policy and is expected to take on an expanded role in the president-elect’s second term. He’s been closely involved in Trump’s transition process and will have a key role in future staffing decisions. During the campaign, he frequently traveled to rallies with Trump on his private plane and was increasingly visible as a speaker at events in recent months.

Miller is also a lead architect of the president-elect’s plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. He has said that a second Trump administration would seek a tenfold increase in the number of deportations to more than 1 million per year. In an interview on Fox News last week, Miller expressed eagerness at the prospect of beginning mass deportations as soon as possible.

“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” he said.

Asked about the expected announcement, Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN, “President-elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.”

A longtime hardliner on immigration, Miller was instrumental in setting up immigration restrictions during the first Trump administration, advocating for child separation in migrant detention facilities and a travel ban targeting people from majority-Muslim countries.

After Trump left office, Miller started an advisory group called America First Legal, which went on to contribute to Project 2025, the sweeping conservative blueprint for the next Republican president created by the Heritage Foundation. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025, claiming that he had no idea who was behind it, despite its close ties to Miller and other crucial figures in Trump’s orbit.

In an interview with The New York Times last year, Miller said that under a second Trump term, the military would build detention centers to house immigrants who have been arrested and are facing deportation. The new camps would likely be built “on open land in Texas near the border,” he told The Times.

Miller told The Times that Trump’s immigration plans are being designed to avoid having to create new substantial legislation. During Trump’s first term, he relied heavily on executive orders to implement immigration policy. Many of those moves were challenged in the courts, something Miller acknowledged would likely happen again in a second Trump term.

In his comments last year, Miller was up-front about his belief that Trump would not hesitate to implement harsh immigration measures in a second term.

“Any activists who doubt President Trump’s resolve in the slightest are making a drastic error: Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown,” Miller said at the time.

This story has been updated with additional background information.

CNN’s Michelle Shen contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html,"President-elect Donald Trump is set to appoint Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser and a strong advocate for restrictive immigration policies, as White House deputy chief of staff for policy.

Despite Trump distancing himself from Project 2025, a conservative blueprint tied to Miller, the latter remains committed to implementing stringent immigration enforcement and has indicated the possibility of constructing new detention centers using federal power in a second Trump administration."

President-elect Donald Trump has named Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. A longtime Trump ally, Stefanik is a staunch supporter of Israel and has also been critical of the UN for what she argues is a lack of sufficient backing for its war against Hamas. “Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,” Trump said in a statement confirming the first cabinet pick of his second term. If confirmed, Stefanik would replace UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat who worked for the US Foreign Service for 35 years.

Stefanik said she was ""deeply humbled"" to accept Trump's nomination and was looking forward to ""earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate"", which must vote on her nomination to make it official. “America continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek,"" Stefanik added in a statement given to the New York Post. The New York Congresswoman has minimal experience in foreign policy and national security. She has served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Since Hamas's 7 October attack, she has become one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel in Congress, garnering national attention as she led congressional hearings about university presidents' handling of protests on college campuses.

1731361259,2024-11-10,Politics,"Trump talked to Putin, told Russian leader not to escalate in Ukraine","President-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, the first phone conversation between the two men since Trump won the election, said several people familiar with the matter. During the call, which Trump took from his resort in Florida, he advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of Washington’s sizable military presence in Europe, said a person familiar with the call, who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.

The two men discussed the goal of peace on the European continent and Trump expressed an interest in follow-up conversations to discuss “the resolution of Ukraine’s war soon,” one of the people said.

In his presidential campaign, Trump said he would bring an immediate end to the war in Ukraine, though did not offer details about how he intended to do so. He has signaled privately that he would support a deal where Russia kept some captured territory, and during the call he briefly raised the issue of land, people familiar with the matter said.

The call, which has not been previously reported, comes amid general uncertainty about how Trump will reset the world’s diplomatic chessboard of U.S. allies and adversaries after his decisive victory on Tuesday. Trump told NBC on Thursday that he had spoken to about 70 world leaders since the election, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — a call that Elon Musk also joined.

Ukrainian officials have been informed of the Putin call and did not object to the conversation taking place, said two people familiar with the matter. Ukrainian officials have long understood that Trump would engage with Putin on a diplomatic solution to the war, the people said.

Trump’s initial calls with world leaders are not being conducted with the support of the State Department and U.S. government interpreters. The Trump transition team has yet to sign an agreement with the General Services Administration, a standard procedure for presidential transitions. Trump and his aides are distrustful of career government officials following the leaked transcripts of presidential calls during his first term. “They are just calling [Trump] directly,” one of the people familiar with the calls said.

“President Trump won a historic election decisively and leaders from around the world know America will return to prominence on the world stage. That is why leaders have begun the process of developing stronger relationships with the 45th and 47th President because he represents global peace and stability,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, in an email.

Moscow initially responded coolly to Trump’s win, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov telling reporters that Putin had no plans to call the incoming president of “an unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.”

But on Thursday, Putin publicly congratulated Trump on his victory, praising his “manly” response to the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, and said he was “ready” to speak with Trump.

Peskov did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After this report was published, the Kremlin on Monday denied the call took place, with Peskov saying it was “completely untrue.”

Earlier Sunday, a journalist with the Russian state TV channel Rossiya, Pavel Zarubin, published an interview with Peskov in which the Kremlin spokesman said the signs for an improvement in relations under a Trump presidency were “positive.”

“Trump talked during his campaign about how he sees everything through deals, that he can make a deal that will lead everyone to peace. At least he talks about peace, not about confrontation and the desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia,” Peskov said.

While President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s strategy in relation to Ukraine was predictable, Peskov added, “Trump is less predictable, and also [it] is less predictable to what extent Trump will stick to the statements he made during the election campaign. Let’s wait and see.”

Trump’s call with Zelensky on Wednesday was amicable but comes as officials in Kyiv are anxious about what a Trump presidency might mean for the war effort, said people familiar with the call.

Ukraine requires billions of dollars in economic and military support every month to continue to fend off its bigger and better-equipped foe, which has made significant military advances in recent months. Trump has complained about the war’s cost to U.S. taxpayers and privately noted that Ukraine may have to give up some of its territory, such as Crimea, for peace.

Tensions between Ukraine and the Trump campaign were heightened following Zelensky’s visit to an ammunition plant in Pennsylvania in September. The visit to the swing state was criticized as a political stunt by Trump allies, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), who called for Zelensky to fire his ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.

Zelensky is now reviewing candidates to replace her, said an official in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

News of the call comes as Ukraine on Sunday launched a major drone attack on Moscow and five other Russian regions, injuring one person and forcing three airports to temporarily halt operations, officials in Moscow said.

Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defense systems intercepted 84 Ukrainian drones over the Moscow, Bryansk, Oryol, Kaluga, Kursk and Tula regions. Thirty-four of those drones were shot down over the Moscow region, the ministry said — making it the largest Ukrainian drone attack on the capital since Russia invaded the country more than two years ago.

Meanwhile, Ukraine is bracing to hold land it gained in Russia’s Kursk region amid reports that Moscow is preparing a counteroffensive. U.S. intelligence agencies have reported that there are now at least 10,000 North Korean troops in the Kursk region, which could be used to buoy the Russian attempt to retake lost territory.

Ukrainian commanders have told The Washington Post that North Korean troops are also in Russia’s neighboring Belgorod region.

While Trump has not spelled out a plan to end the war, he has said it would have benefited Ukraine to make a deal earlier in the war as the country continues to lose soldiers, civilians and infrastructure.

“Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,” Trump said during a speech in North Carolina in September. “If they made a bad deal it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.”

“What deal can we make? It’s demolished,” he said. “The people are dead. The country is in rubble.”

A former U.S. official who was apprised of the Putin call said that Trump probably does not want to enter office with a fresh crisis in Ukraine prompted by escalation by Russia, “giving him incentive to want to keep the war from worsening.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/10/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine/,"President-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, advising against escalating the war in Ukraine and highlighting the U.S. military presence in Europe, after his election victory.

The Washington Post first reported the call had taken place, citing unidentified sources, and said Trump had told Putin that he should not escalate the Ukraine war.

But, in an unusual move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday no such call had taken place.

Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Wednesday.

Asked about the purported Trump-Putin call, Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said, ""We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.""

The Republican will take office on Jan. 20 after defeating Vice-President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden has invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Biden's top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what's happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East.

""President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,"" Sullivan told CBS News's Face the Nation show.

Massive drone attack on Moscow

Sullivan's comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war. On Monday, drones, glide bombs and a ballistic missile struck southern Ukraine, killing at least six civilians and injuring around 30 others.

When asked if Biden would ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred.

""I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,"" Sullivan said.

Russia has been signaling to the United States and its allies for weeks that if they give permission to Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied missiles, then Moscow will consider it a major escalation.

Putin said on Sept. 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean ""the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine"" because NATO military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles.

WATCH | Trump has criticized sending Ukraine billions in military aid: Ukraine, Russia brace for Trump’s return to the White House Duration 2:13 Some Ukrainians are expressing uneasiness that Donald Trump’s U.S. election win could mean an end to the country's support against Russia. Trump has publicly criticized sending Ukraine billions in military aid, and has said he could make a deal to ‘end the war in a day.’

Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of U.S. military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers.

Trump insisted last year that Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters that Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject and that Biden has never suggested.

Zelenskyy said on Thursday he was not aware of any details of Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv.

WATCH | Expert weighs in on Trump, Ukraine and Musk: Musk will be a ‘force’ in U.S. government, war in Ukraine: expert says | Canada Tonight Duration 6:37 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that he spoke with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump following his victory. Additionally, multiple outlets have reported that billionaire Elon Musk joined the call as well. Nicholas Drummond, a former British Army officer, says Musk could be a ‘good’ influence on Trump.

According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion US to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the U.S. Senate with a 52-seat majority. Control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear, with some votes still being counted.

Putin casts the 2½-year-old war as a battle between Russia and the declining West, which he says ignored Russia's interests after the 1991 Soviet collapse.

Ukraine and its Western allies say Putin unleashed an imperial-style war against its smaller neighbour and have repeatedly said that if Russia wins the war then autocratic countries across the world will be emboldened.

Republican U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticized U.S. funding for Ukraine, in a CBS interview.

""The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine-1.7380033,"Conflicting reports have emerged regarding a purported phone call between U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with an unnamed source claiming Trump advised Putin not to escalate the Ukraine war, while the Kremlin denied any such conversation occurred. Trump's criticism of extensive U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine, and suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory for peace, stand in contrast to President Biden's steadfast support for Ukraine, which may change with a Republican-controlled Senate under Trump's incoming administration. Meanwhile, Ukraine continues to engage in significant military actions against Russia, highlighting ongoing tensions as allies express concerns over the implications of Trump's policies and potential diplomatic strategy for the conflict."
